## About

<a name="about"></a>

_Knooppuntnet_ is a website for planning routes through walking,
cycling and other types of node networks in OpenStreetMap. It provides support for
analysis and quality assurance of these networks, and monitoring long distance walking routes.

- [wiki documentation](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Knooppuntnet)

## Screenshots

<a name="screenshots"></a>

You can plan a walking route by clicking on a start node and destination node 
(and optionally intermediate nodes that you want to pass through). You can output
the planned route in a pdf document and/or a gpx track.

In the analysis section of knooppuntnet, you can get an overview of all nodes and routes
in a given node network, and explore issues that knooppuntnet finds. Directs links to
editors make it easier to fix problems in the OpenStreetMap database.

![analysis](docs/readme-analysis.png)

You can look at the changes to the OpenStreetMap database that affect the node networks in near realtime.

![changes](docs/readme-changes.png)

For long distance walking routes, you can compare GPX traces with the mapping of the
route in OpenStreetMap.  This allows you to find problems in the OpenStreetMap database
and/or the GPX trace.

## How to contribute?

<a name="contribute"></a>

Here are a number of ways of how you can contribute to the project:

- validate routes on the ground

- map additional nodes/routes/networks

- report errors

- application translation

- documentation

- application testing

- application code

### Translations

<a name="translations"></a>

The intention is to have _knooppuntnet_ available in four languages: English, Dutch, German and French.

#### Wiki

The application documentation is in the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Knooppuntnet). Feel
free
to add to this and/or translate to other languages.

#### Application

Your help in translating the application to a language that is not fully translated yet, or
to fix wrong translations, is very welcome.

The base language for the application is English. Support for translation to the other languages
is kindly provided free of charge by [POEditor](https://poeditor.com). POEditor supports
open source. Many thanks!!!

Follow this [link](https://poeditor.com/join/project/Bfvs2fvcYI) to join the knooppuntnet translation project.

From the project start page you can select the language. In the _"Translations"_ tab you can review all translations
(select _"Show: translated"_), or bring up the list with all texts that still need translation (select _"Show:
Untranslated"_).
From these lists the translated texts can be entered and/or changed. Click the text to start editing.

All the translations you make here will appear in the knooppuntnet website in the next release.

The above is sufficient to help out with the translations.

A bit more advanced: if you like to review your translation changes without waiting for the next release,
you can follow the instructions in the section _"Install application locally"_ below.

In the POEditor page for your language, you can go to the _"Export"_ tab. Select _"Show Advanced Options"_.
Select _"Export: All"_ and _"Filename: translations.XX.xlf"_ where XX is the 2 letter code for given language:

| Language | Command             
|----------|---------------------
| Dutch    | translations.nl.xlf 
| German   | translations.de.xlf 
| French   | translations.fr.xlf 

Klik _"Export"_ and save the file in the _"locale"_ directory in your git clone:

	knooppuntnet/frontend/src/locale

To see your translations in action, restart the application in development for given
language, for example (from directory knooppuntnet/frontend):

	npm run serve:translation:de

Note: changes to the English texts have to be done directly in the application code.

### Install application locally

These are the instructions for installing the client application on your local computer (for development purposes).

#### node.js and npm

We use _"npm"_ to manage the software dependencies and to help in installing
and running the client application.

If you do not have a version of node.js installed, please follow the [directions for installation on nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

#### git

We use git as our version control system. Although it is also possible to download
the code as a zip file, it will be easier to immediately use git, especially if the
intention is to contribute to the project afterwards.

Go to [git downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions.

#### Install and run

Get the source code:

	git clone https://github.com/vmarc/knooppuntnet.git

Install the software and fetch all dependencies:

	cd knooppuntnet/frontend/
	npm install

Build and run the client:

	ng serve

In a web browser on your computer, open:

    http://localhost:4000

The above command will build and start the English version of the application in development mode.
Use one of the following commands to start the application in another language:

| Language | Command             
|----------|---------------------
| Dutch    | `npm run serve:translation:nl` 
| German   | `npm run serve:translation:de` 
| French   | `npm run serve:translation:fr` 

When starting the application in a language other than English, the texts that are not translated yet are shown in English.

### OpenStreetMap mapping

<a name="mapping"></a>

You can contribute by adding, updating or reviewing the node and route definitions
in OpenStreetMap. Any changes made there will become available in the application soon
after upload to OpenStreetMap.

### Reporting issues

<a name="issues"></a>

Issues can be reported in [github](https://github.com/vmarc/knooppuntnet/issues), or through
an OpenStreetMap message to [vmarc](https://www.openstreetmap.org/message/new/vmarc).

> _Note: when submitting issues, please feel free to use English, Dutch, French or German._

### Application testing

<a name="testing"></a>

Review these
documented [planner interaction tests](https://github.com/vmarc/knooppuntnet/blob/develop/docs/planner-interactions.md).
